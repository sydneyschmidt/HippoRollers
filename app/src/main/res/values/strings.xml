    <string name="info">
        The Roll a Hippo Foundation supplies hippo water rollers to women in rural Africa to
        transport water. This is a huge improvement from the traditional method, which is to carry
        water in five gallon buckets on the head. The water roller holds up to five times as much
        weight, but is much easier to transport, saving time and energy.
        To learn more about the foundation and how you can help, visit their website or check out
        the video below.
